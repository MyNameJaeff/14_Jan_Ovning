# Risk of Rain 2 Website
We had as an assignment to create a website to sell a ware, game or anything at all. I chose one of my favorite games, Risk of Rain 2. 
I didn't know how to sell the game to potential buyers, so i went with my gut feeling about what people would care about when buying a game, so i added a bunch of info surrounding the game's content.

## Styling
The styling isn't anything im happy with but seeing as i had about 3h total time i didn't have time to make changes and fix the stuff i disliked. I also had no time to create a Figma so im blaming it on a time-crunch.

## Closing thoughts
I don't know really, itÂ´s just a website i guess. Another straw in the stack, the one thing im kind of happy with is the popup when "buying" the game.
